        "Even though both datasets have dimensionality 784, the dataset with 2500 datapoints contains significantly more information about the true data distribution. With only 4 datapoints, the variance is artificially limited and concentrated in very few directions. When using 2500 datapoints, PCA captures a more realistic variance structure of MNIST, so more principal components are required to explain 99% of the variance."
